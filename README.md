## 🎯 Scope & Goals

* Identify exposed internal services 🖥️
* Enumerate users, shares, and trusts 👥
* Exploit weak configurations or credentials 🔑
* Escalate privileges & move laterally 🚪
* Demonstrate real-world business risks 📊

## 🛠️ Lab Setup (for practice)

* 🖥️ Windows Server (Active Directory)
* 🖥️ Linux/Windows Application Server
* 💻 Windows Workstation
* 🎯 Attacker VM (Kali/Parrot)

## 🔎 Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance** 🌐 → Identify live hosts & services
2. **Scanning & Enumeration** 📡 → Gather detailed info
3. **Vulnerability Analysis** 🕵️ → Find weaknesses
4. **Exploitation** 💥 → Gain access
5. **Privilege Escalation** 🔝 → Get higher privileges
6. **Lateral Movement** 🔄 → Expand access
7. **Reporting** 📑 → Document findings

## 💻 Example Commands

```bash
# Nmap scan
nmap -sV 10.0.0.0/24

# SMB share enumeration
smbclient -L \\10.0.0.5 -N

# Password spraying
crackmapexec smb 10.0.0.0/24 -u users.txt -p 'Password123'
```
